The project was inspired by the work of the Location Aware Sensing System (LASS) community, which engages citizens to participate in the PM2.5 sensing project and enables them to make low-cost PM2.5 sensing devices on their own. It also facilitates PM2.5 monitoring at a finer spatio-temporal granularity and enriches environmental data analysis by making all measurement data freely available to everyone. Till 2017/08, there have been more than 3,500 AirBox devices deployed in 30 countries worldwide.\nDescription Each sample dataset is a CSV (or zipped CSV) file that contains measurements of timestamp, GPS coordinates, temperature, relative humidity, PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 of AirBox devices in Taiwan in the given period. The detailed hardware information is below:\n Device: Edimax AirBox AI-1001W V1 and V2  Temperature/Humidity sensor: HTS221 PM1/2.5/10 sensor: Plantower PMS5003 Sample rate: every 5-6 minutes    Note that, some AirBox devices are using the old version firmware that does not provide PM1/PM10 measurement results. Moreover, due to different reasons, disconnection and reconnection are frequent in the dataset, and missing data is common for all the AirBox devices.\nDownload Note that this dataset is released for research institutes and non-profit organizations only. If you are from industry or plan to use this dataset for commercial purposes, you are NOT eligible to download this dataset, and please go to this page for more detailed information.\n January 2017, Taiwan: [.csv] [.tgz] February 2017, Taiwan: [.csv] [.tgz] March 2017, Taiwan: [.csv] [.tgz]  If you are interested in accessing real-time AirBox data, please refer to the \u0026ldquo;API\u0026rdquo; session on the PM2.5 Open Data Portal website.\nHow to cite this dataset?
